\bioctitle[nowaclean]{Cleaning the NOWAC postdiagnostic data set with
  \Rpackage{nowaclean}}

\begin{abstract}
This vignette describes the cleaning of the NOWAC postdiagnostic microarray data
set with the \Rpackage{nowaclean} \R{} package, which implements the standard
operating procedure for detecting and removing technical outliers in the NOWAC
microarray data.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This vignette describes the data cleaning performed on the Norwegian Women and
Cancer (NOWAC) postdiagnostic data set. The data cleaning process starts out
with some preprocessing where we remove some uninformative probes and some
samples where the controls have since gotten cancer (and can hence no longer be
considered healthy controls). The main focus of this vignette is to show outlier
removal and so we have placed this preprocessing in
Appendix~\ref{appendix:preprocessing}. Section~\ref{section:package} briefly
describes the \Rpackage{nowaclean} \R{} package.
Section~\ref{section:outliers} describes the removal of technical outliers.
A necessary step after outlier removal is background correction; this will not
be described here.

\subsection{Installation and loading}
Currently \Rpackage{nowaclean} is hosted only on
GitHub.\footnote{\url{https://github.com}} To install from GitHub you need to install
the \CRANpkg{devtools} package.
<<devtools, eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages("devtools")
@

Once you have installed \CRANpkg{devtools}, you can use it to install
\Rpackage{nowaclean} from its GitHub repository.
<<nowaclean_install, eval=FALSE>>=
library(devtools)
install_github("3inar/nowaclean")
@
Once it is installed, you can use \Rpackage{nowaclean} like you would any other \R{}
package.
<<nowaclean_load>>=
library(nowaclean)

\section{Loading and Preprocessing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% PREPROCESSING
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
So now we load the dataset; we have suppressed the huge text dump that happens
when you load the \Rpackage{lumi} package:
<<load_data, message=FALSE>>=
library(lumi)  # Required to access LumiBatch objects
datapath <- "/project/data1/tice2/PostDiagnostic/GRC-244_postdiagnostic.RData"
load(datapath)
class(grc244)
dim(grc244)

# friendlier name
data <- grc244 # p x n
@
The \Rcode{grc244} object is a \Rcode{LumiBatch} object that contains 47323
probes for 868 samples.

We'll now remove some probes to do with blood type that aren't especially
interesting w.r.t cancer. The \Rfunction{blood\_probes} function returns the
nuIDs of these probes.
<<names and hist>>=
histo_boolean <- !rownames(data) %in% blood_probes()
data <- data[histo_boolean, ]

# also extract gene expression matrix, transpose to get samples x probes
expression <- t(exprs(data))
